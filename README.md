## Expected functionality

This CLI would be able to do most of the things that the user interface would be able to do. Some of these include

- Creating and customizing global links without an account
- Logging in/Signing up an account
- Get analytics
- Edit links
- Change operations to a self hosted instance

(Release expected after Pckd Version 2)
